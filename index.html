		As hate crimes against the Jewish community increase, New York Police Department's data reveals majority of these incidents occur in South Brooklyn.
	</p>

	<p>	Over the last five years, there have been a total of 845 Jewish hate crimes reported in New York City. Nearly 42% of those 
		offenses were reported to Brooklyn precincts. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Areas with high numbers of Jewish hate crime reports included police precincts 60, 61, 66, 70 and 71. This region of South Brooklyn is comprised of neighborhoods such as Coney Island, Crown Heights, Midwood, Kensington and Borough Park. 
	</p> 

	<p>
		Earlier this year, a man was charged with arson after setting fire to a synagogue and yeshiva in Borough Park, Brooklyn. In November, vandals toppled over a menorah in Queens, which is a similar incident that occurred with the exact menorah in 2014. 
	</p> 

	<p>
		Anti-Semitic attacks have increased in the last year, whether it is in the form of property damage or physical confrontations. 
	</p> 

	<p>
		Dr. Colleen Mills, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Penn State Abington, said that anti-religious hate crimes are more likely to involve property damage. 
	</p>

	<p>
		"The presence of 'Jewish buildings' like Jewish synagogues or community centers or schools...had more of those places see more anti-Jewish hate crime," Mills said.
	</p>

	<p>
		She added, "those property offenses they are usually things like vandalism, for example, that like a perpetrator could do very quickly and get away."
	</p>

	<p>
		For Brooklyn's 66th precinct, the area has over 300 religious' institutions, comprised mostly of Hassidic and Orthodox Synagogues and yeshivas, according to NYC's website. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The area, Borough Park, is comprised of 100,000 people of Jewish descent, according to an article written by Ann-Renee Rubia. The area also has the highest five-year total of Jewish hate crimes reported in New York City. 
	</p> 

	<p>
		"I would attribute higher numbers in Brooklyn to just the greater presence of a Jewish population, and more of buildings that would be suitable targets for victimization for those perpetrators," Mills said.
	</p>

	<p>	
		If you or anyone you know have experienced bias-motivated threats, harassment or discrimination, please call New York's Hate Crimes Task Force hotline at 1-888-392-3644 or Text "HATE" to 81336 to report the incident.
